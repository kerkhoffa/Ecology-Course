### Required Texts

The main text for this class is Hacker, Bowman, and Cain's *Ecology* (4th Edition)

Much additional material is openly available on the course website. Much of it is 
drawn from [Nature Knowledge Project: Ecology](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/ecology-102), 
which is freely available on the web.


### Course Description

Ecology is the study of the distribution and abundance of organisms and the structure and 
dynamics of ecosystems. Topics will bioclimatology, environmental physiology, population dynamics and
species interactions, community assembly, energy flow, nutrient cycling, and the biodiversity,
and functioning of the global ecosystem. Most of the focus is on terrestrial systems, but we will 
consider the freshwater and marine ecosystems as well. Our studies will be motivated by the major ecological
challenges of the Anthropocene: biodiversity loss and climate change.


### Prerequisite Knowledge, Skills, and Motivation

Knowledge of basic biology, a strong interest in developing a scientific, quantitative understanding 
of how nature works, and a desire to participate in and reflect on your own learning process.


### Course Goals and Methods

Through this course you will learn to:
* Explain and predict ecological phenomena at multiple scales and levels of organization.
* Hone your skills in reading primary literature, and communicating its insights to multiple audiences.
* Formulate ecological questions and propose ways of answering them.

These skills will be achieved through readings, discussions, lectures, homework and in-class problem sets, 
writing, and at least some time outside, looking at nature. We will examine the primary literature of 
ecology, with a focus on translating technical communication into more accessible forms. In addition
to a generalized understanding of the natural history of Earth and her organisms, ecology also incorporates 
varied field, laboratory, mathematical, statistical, and computational approaches, but no prior expertise is 
assumed. I will give focus to our ecological studies, assist you in attaining your own understanding of the 
subject, and provide both formal and informalfeedback and mentorship.

**Our roles require that all of us come to class sessions prepared.** 

### How this course relates to the Biology and Environmental Studies majors.

This course satisfies upper-level lecture credit in Environmental Biology for the 
[Biology Major](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/registrar/course-catalog-2/course-requirements/requirements-biology/#major), and as an elective Living Systems course for the
[ENVS Major](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/registrar/course-catalog-2/course-requirements/requirements-environmental-studies/).


## Course Policies


### Attendance

Class attendance is mandatory and unexcused absences will negatively affect your grade. In-class work 
missed due to unexcused absences may not be made up without expressed consent of the instructor.

### Excused Absences

In order to have an absence excused, you must contact me *before* you miss a class (email is best). If 
you are an athlete or a member of another organization that travels, it is your responsibility (not 
your coach’s or advisor’s) to make arrangements with me concerning missed classes at least one meeting 
before the missed class session. Failure to do so may result in unexcused absences.

### Late Work

Every attempt should be made to submit assignments on time because assignments build on one another 
and it can be hard to catch up if you fall behind. That being said, *life happens* and therefore 
there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for the submission of late assignments with no need
to request an extension. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted, especially if
the requests come before the assignment is due.

Assignments turned in after the 48 hour grace period without an extension will be graded with an inital 
20% penalty, further decaying at a rate of 5% per day.


### Turning in Assignments

Unless instructed otherwise, all assignments will be turned in via Moodle.


### Accommodating Disabilities and Learning Differences

I want to help learn and will happily work with you to make the learning environment 
equitable for you and others.

Students who anticipate they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact 
of a learning, physical, or psychological disability are encouraged to meet with me privately 
early in the semester. In addition, you must contact the [Office of Student Accessibility and Support Services](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/student-accessibility-support-services/) as soon as 
possible, to register for reasonable academic accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary
inconvenience and delays.


### Academic Honesty and Plagiarism

I expect all of us to honestly represent our own work and understanding, and to cite the work of others 
appropriately.

Kenyon College is, at the core, an intellectual community of scholars – students and faculty – 
engaged in the free and open exchange of ideas. Critical to this lively exchange is the academic 
integrity of our work, both inside and outside the classroom. It is the responsibility of each 
student to learn and practice the proper ways of documenting and acknowledging those whose ideas 
and words you have drawn upon (see course catalog pages on [Academic Integrity](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/registrar/course-catalog-2/administrative-matters/academic-integrity-and-questions-of-plagiarism/)).  

Ignorance and carelessness are not excuses for academic dishonesty.  If you are uncertain about the expectations for academic honesty in this class, especially with group work, please ask for clarification.


### Appropriate Conduct

I want to foster an inclusive, welcoming, challenging, and respectful community in our class.

Kenyon seeks to provide an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment 
based on sex; racial, ethnic, national, religious, or cultural background; sexual orientation; 
disability status; gender identity or expression; veteran status; or political viewpoint. As 
expressed by President Decatur, a central principle of a rigorous liberal education in a diverse 
community is to “Challenge rigorously, but with respect.” We will abide by this principle in this class.

If you have been the victim of sexual harassment, misconduct, or assault, I encourage you to report. 
If you report this to me or any other faculty member, as a "responsible party," the professor must notify 
Kenyon's Civil Rights/Title IX coordinator about the basic facts of the incident (you may choose whether 
you or anyone involved is identified by name). For more information, consult the [Kenyon Office for Civil Rights](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/ocr/).






## Grading Policies

Grading for this course is based on 13 equally weighted assignments.

Exercises in assignments will be graded as follows:

* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect
    answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept:
    50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%


### Grading scale

- **A 93-100**
- **A- 90-92**
- **B+ 87-89**
- **B 83-86**

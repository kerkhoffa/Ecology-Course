### Required Texts

The main text for this class is Hacker, Bowman, and Cain's *Ecology* (4th Edition)

Much additional material is openly available on the course website. Much of it is drawn from [Nature Knowledge Project: Ecology](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/ecology-102), which is freely available on the web.


### Course Description

Ecology is the science of how nature works. In practoce ecologists study of the distribution and abundance of organisms and the structure and dynamics of ecosystems, developing theories and models to explain patterns in nature based upon fundamental processes. Topics will include bioclimatology, environmental physiology, population dynamics and species interactions, community assembly, energy flow, nutrient cycling, and the biodiversity, and functioning of the global ecosystem. Most of the focus is on terrestrial systems, but we will consider the freshwater and marine ecosystems as well. Our studies will be motivated by the major ecological challenges of the Anthropocene: biodiversity loss and climate change.


### Prerequisite Knowledge, Skills, and Motivation

Knowledge of basic biology, a strong interest in developing a scientific, quantitative understanding of how nature works, and a desire to participate in and reflect on your own learning process.


### Course Goals and Methods

Through this course you will learn to:
* Explain and predict ecological phenomena at multiple scales and levels of organization.
* Hone your skills in reading primary literature, and communicating its insights to multiple audiences.
* Formulate ecological questions and propose ways of answering them.

These skills will be achieved through readings, discussions, lectures, homework and in-class problem sets, writing, and at least some time outside, looking at nature. We will examine the primary literature of ecology, with a focus on translating technical communication into more accessible forms. In addition to a generalized understanding of the natural history of Earth and her organisms, ecology also incorporates varied field, laboratory, mathematical, statistical, and computational approaches, but no prior expertise is assumed. I will give focus to our ecological studies, assist you in attaining your own understanding of the subject, and provide both formal and informal feedback and mentorship.

**Our roles require that all of us come to class sessions prepared.** 

### How this course relates to the Biology and Environmental Studies majors.

This course satisfies upper-level lecture credit in Environmental Biology for the [Biology Major](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/registrar/course-catalog-2/course-requirements/requirements-biology/#major), and as an elective Living Systems course for the [ENVS Major](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/registrar/course-catalog-2/course-requirements/requirements-environmental-studies/).

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Class attendance is mandatory and unexcused absences will negatively affect your grade. In-class work missed due to unexcused absences may not be made up without expressed consent of the instructor.

### Excused Absences

In order to have an absence excused, you must contact me *before* you miss a class (email is best). If you are an athlete or a member of another organization that travels, it is your responsibility (not your coach’s or advisor’s) to make arrangements with me concerning missed classes at least one meeting before the missed class session. Failure to do so may result in unexcused absences.

### Late Work and Missed Assignments

Every attempt should be made to submit assignments on time because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up if you fall behind. That being said, *life happens* and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for the submission of late assignments with no needto request an extension. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted, especially if the requests come before the assignment is due.

In the case of absence, I reserve the right to determine what can and cannot be made-up, depending on the assignment and the circumstances. Fairness and educational value will guide my decision.

Assignments turned in after the 48 hour grace period without an extension will be graded with an inital 20% penalty, further decaying at a rate of 5% per day.

### Turning in Assignments

Unless instructed otherwise, all assignments will be turned in via Moodle and/or Turnitin.

### Format for Written Work 

Unless otherwise instructed, all written assignments must meet the following specifications:
* 12-point font
*	Double spaced
*	1-inch margins all around
*	page numbers must be indicated
*	Your name at the top of the first page
*	If submitted on paper, it must be stapled
*	If submitted electronically, it must be in pdf format, with your name and the assignment indicated in the file name, *e.g.*, KerkhoffNewsEssayDraft.pdf.

Work that does not meet these criteria will be returned and assessed a 5% penalty.

## Grading Policies

Your course grade will be based on the following categories and their respective weights. Most work outside of class will be submitted via Moodle and all written work will be run through Turnitin to support academic honesty

* Attendance, Participation, and Enthusiasm (10%)
* Reading Responses and Quizzes (15%)
* Homework and Exercises (15%)
* News and Views Essays (30%)
* Exams (30%)

**Attendance, Participation, and Enthusiasm:** Participation and enthusiasm is not just the number of times you raise your hand or speak up in class. I am looking for consistent engagement with the material, real curiosity about understanding how nature works, and a willingness to share your thoughts with me and with the class in whatever way comes most naturally to you. Submitting thoughtful reading responses, engaging in small group discussions, visiting office hours to talk about course material, seeking clarification during class; All of these, and much more, demonstrate participation and enthusiasm.

**Reading Response Questions and Quizzes:** In order to have a productive discussion and be ready to address problems, it is critical to read the assigned material *before class*. Thus, reading responses must be submitted by 11 pm the day before the readings are covered. Short, unannounced quizzes focused on the readings will be given occasionally. Any class session is a possibility and the quiz may cover readings or any material covered in class that day.

**Homework and Exercises:** Homework assignments and in-class exercises will be used to reinforce concepts and to provide opportunities to practice ecological problem solving. These assignments and exercises will involve writing, quantitative aspects of the course, and working with the primary literature.

**News and Views Essays:** Scientific communication is incredibly important, especially in ecology, which directly addresses some of the largest challenges humans face. Writing about science is hard and takes practice. You will write and revise two short essays (a “News” piece for a general audience and a “Views” piece for a more scientific readership), based on a recently published piece of ecological research. The goals are: 1) to communicate the particulars of a scientific breakthrough in ecology to two different audiences that vary in scientific literacy, 2) to comment critically on strengths and limitations of the work and to put it into the broader context of the field, and 3) to tell an engaging and interesting, even entertaining, scientific story.

**Exams:** The midterm exams cover all material, both in the readings and in the lecture/discussion. Questions will emphasize critical thinking, the evaluation of written and graphical information, and the application of ecological principles in novel contexts. Two midterm exams will cover specific sections of the course, while the final exam will be comprehensive, focused on synthesizing core principles of the field.

### Accommodating Disabilities and Learning Differences

I want to help learn and will happily work with you to make the learning environment equitable for you and others.

Students who anticipate they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact of a learning, physical, or psychological disability are encouraged to meet with me privately early in the semester. In addition, you must contact the [Office of Student Accessibility and Support Services](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/student-accessibility-support-services/) as soon as possible, to register for reasonable academic accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessaryinconvenience and delays.


### Academic Honesty and Plagiarism

I expect all of us to honestly represent our own work and understanding, and to cite the work of others appropriately.

Kenyon College is, at the core, an intellectual community of scholars – students and faculty – engaged in the free and open exchange of ideas. Critical to this lively exchange is the academic integrity of our work, both inside and outside the classroom. It is the responsibility of each student to learn and practice the proper ways of documenting and acknowledging those whose ideas and words you have drawn upon (see course catalog pages on [Academic Integrity](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/registrar/course-catalog-2/administrative-matters/academic-integrity-and-questions-of-plagiarism/)).  

Ignorance and carelessness are not excuses for academic dishonesty.  If you are uncertain about the expectations for academic honesty in this class, especially with group work, please *ask for clarification*.


### Appropriate Conduct

I want to foster an inclusive, welcoming, challenging, and respectful community in our class.

Kenyon seeks to provide an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment based on sex; racial, ethnic, national, religious, or cultural background; sexual orientation; disability status; gender identity or expression; veteran status; or political viewpoint. As expressed by President Decatur, a central principle of a rigorous liberal education in a diverse community is to “Challenge rigorously, but with respect.” We will abide by this principle in this class.

If you have been the victim of sexual harassment, misconduct, or assault, I encourage you to report. If you report this to me or any other faculty member, as a "responsible party," the professor must notify Kenyon's Civil Rights/Title IX coordinator about the basic facts of the incident (you may choose whetheryou or anyone involved is identified by name). For more information, consult the [Kenyon Office for Civil Rights](https://www.kenyon.edu/directories/offices-services/ocr/).
